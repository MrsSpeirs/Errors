 * This program is for error checking.  Find the errors and fix them!
 * When you have a working project with the following output - note the format:
 *      The average of 100, 95 and 90 is: 95.0
 *      The value of j is 3
 *      The value of k is 1.5
 *      100 / 10.0 equals 10.0
 * Remember to change the name of the author and finish the comments
 * to describe where, what and which type of error you found
 * You must use variables for output and the value must be attained
 * through the use of math operators and variables not just typing the output above
